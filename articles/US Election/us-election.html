		<h1><center><FONT COLOR="#707070">US Elections & Voting Rules</FONT COLOR></center></h1>
		<hr color=800080 width=60%>
		<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">It started with my mom and I watching this year’s United States presidential election results. I had never monitored an election before and needed a lot of help to understand what was happening. So, my mother had to explain.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">Then she suggested I write an article on how the election works. So here goes.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#707070"> Rules to Vote</FONT COLOR></h2>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">To vote in the US presidential election first, one must have US citizenship, and second, one must be 18 or over.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The day on which the election is held is always the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The election is held every 4 years.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>

<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">There are 3 different ways to vote in the election.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>
 <ul>
  <li><p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The first way is in-person voting. In this case, one goes to the polling booth and casts their ballot by putting a mark next to the candidate they want. At some polling stations, this is done on a touch screen, but in most, it is done with paper and pen.</font size></FONT COLOR></p></li>
  <li><p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The next way one can cast ballots is through the mail. One has one envelope in which they write their name, address, etc. Then they insert a second envelope that has the ballot inside it.</font size></FONT COLOR></p></li>
  <li><p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The last way is for one to apply for an absentee ballot online, after giving a reason for doing so.</font size></FONT COLOR></p></li>
</ul>
<center><img src=https://kidsbouquethome.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/ballot.jpg style="width:40%"></center>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#707070">Vote Counting</FONT COLOR></h2>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">There are different ways to count the different types of ballots. The in-person ballots are scanned and recorded after everyone has voted and left. The process starts when you leave. One’s ballot is scanned and stored on a memory card by a machine.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The memory card is then sent to the people counting the votes. They add your vote to the appropriate candidate.</font size></font color></p>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">For mailed ballots the counting process is different. One person scans the information in the first envelope of all the ballots, a second scans the ballots in the second envelope, and finally, a third person records the votes for the secret ballot system to work.</font size></font color></p>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">When one fills out an absentee ballot online one’s vote is directly sent to the counting offices. Here too, first, a person records the voter’s information and then someone else records the vote.</font size></font color></p>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#707070">Electoral Votes</FONT COLOR></h2>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">Whichever candidate gets more votes in a particular state, also gets all the electoral votes of that particular state, except for in Maine and Nebraska, where the electoral votes are split just as they are won. The higher the population of the state, the higher the number of electoral votes. Electoral votes rather than popular votes decide the winner. There are a total of 538 electoral votes in the US presidential election. Whichever candidate gets 270 or more electoral votes, wins the election.</font size></font color></p>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#707070">Contingent Election</FONT COLOR></h2>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">If there is <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election#Presidential_election>a tie between two or more candidates</a>, there is a contingent election. Then the congressmen from the house elect the winner from the tied candidates.</font size></font color></p>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#707070">Recount</FONT COLOR></h2>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">But sometimes when one of the candidates wins by a very small margin there is a recount. That means that the votes are counted again to make sure that they counted the votes correctly the first time. There are 2 ways to do the recounts.</font size></font color></p>

<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The first one is called machine counting. In machine counting, machines are used to count votes that were cast on the election day. There are three types of machines used to count the votes. Details can be found here.</font size></font color></p>

<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">The second way to recount is called manual counting. In manual counting, people count the votes. In manual counting, verification papers for each vote are required.</font size></font color></p>
<h2><FONT COLOR="#707070">Term Limits</FONT COLOR></h2>
<p><FONT COLOR="#707070"><font size = "4px">A person can stay president for a limited amount of time. This is called a term limit. A term ends after 4 years and then presidential elections are conducted. A person can serve as president for at most two terms.</font size></font color></p>
