		<hr color=800080 width=60%>
		<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;And it’s done. Irene turn off the lights.” Mom gazed up at the tree.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Just as the lights went off, Dad plugged in the fairy lights, and the tree was illuminated. The family stared in awe at the lush green pine with decorations dangling from every branch. Silver tinsel reflected the fairy lights enveloping the tree in a golden glow . “It’s a beauty, this one is,” Dad declared.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;The tree sure is pretty,” Salsa said, making her way down the stairs with the presents. Irene turned on the lights and the family arranged the gifts.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Irene dashed into her room. She came out with two large red felt stockings to be hung up over the fireplace on the wall behind the Chirstmas tree for Santa.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Mom went to the kitchen and called, “Dinner is ready.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“The lamb is really good,” Dad commented as he relished his dinner.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“I thought I’d try something different,” Mom replied. “I’m glad you like it.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Me too,” said Salsa, while Irene grinned through large mouthfuls.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>After dinner, Salsa popped into her room and returned with some gingerbread men cookies. “Since we didn’t have any dessert today, I picked these up from the store near school.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Yay!” Irene grabbed the box, and helped herself to several cookies.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Well, save some for me and your father, because it’s getting quite late, and we have to pick your grandparents up from the airport. We don’t want to them to wait because it’s a long journey from Chicago,” said Mom staring at the pile of cookies on Irene’s plate. “And no Irene you can’t have more than two cookies.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Irene sadly put the third and fourth cookie she had sneaked out, back into the box. As soon as Irene had beheaded her first gingerbread man, the phone rang.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Salsa went to answer it. “Hello.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Hi, this is Violet’s mom,” came a voice from the telephone.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Hi, Mrs. Walters, this is Salsa.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Um&#8230; I was wondering if you could do me a huge favor. Violet’s dad and I have some urgent business matter we have to take care of. So, could you ask your mom to let Violet come over to celebrate Christmas with you?” Mrs. Walters sounded worried.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Sure, I‘ll ask. Can you hold a minute?” Salsa said glancing at her Mom.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Yeah, sure, Dear.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Mrs. Walters wants to know if Violet can come over for Christmas. Her parents have some urgent business matter to take care of.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Mom gave a thumbs up, and Salsa got back onto the phone. “Yeah, she can come over.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Salsa, listen, can your parents come and pick Violet up? She’s too young to come to your house alone and we have a too much to wrap up before we leave.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Sure,” Salsa replied.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Thanks so much Salsa. You’re a doll. Bye.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Bye,” Salsa disconnected. “Mrs. Walters needs us to pick up Violet,” she told her parents.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Okay, now Dad and I have to leave, so Irene and you go pick up Violet okay?” said Mom. “Take the keys, don’t loose them.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>As Mom and Dad shut the main door behind them, Irene asked, “Can I give Violet a cookie?”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Sure,” Salsa replied</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>The two left the house chatting and laughing. Irene shut the door behind them.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>When they arrived at Violet’s house, she was zipping up her overnight bag. “I know, it’s a mess. I have to clear it up before I can leave the house,” she whined pointing at the table with notes sprawled all over, and a detective game spread across the floor. Pages form a notebook were everywhere. Salsa, Irene and Violet cleared up the room together.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Finally, an hour later,when Salsa and Irene returned with Violet, Salsa jiggled her keys in the lock. “Huh, I must have forgotten to lock the door,” she said, pushing it open. After Salsa shut the door behind them, they took off their shoes in the hallway.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>They entered the living room and Salsa stared. “Where did the tree go?” Irene exclaimed.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;I don’t know!” Salsa sounded frantic, as a key turned in the main door lock.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“We’re ho ..” Mom stopped mid-sentence as she stepped into the living room. “Wh-wh…” she exclaimed.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;I’m carrying, the luggage and in kind of a hurry, so – our tree!” Dad stared and accidentally dropped the suitcase on Grandma’s foot.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Ow! Ted, that wasn’t very nice of you. Move along please. I need to nurse my foot.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Oh, so, sorry,” said Dad who rushed out of the way and pushed Mom to the side too. Grandma rushed into the kitchen. “Mary, your fridge doesn’t open.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Oops, I put the child lock on. Wait, I’ll come and help you.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Why didn’t you all put a tree up here? You do that every Christmas!” Grandpa stared at the corner where the Christmas tree usually stood.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;The tree is gone! It was here before we left the house, and now it’s gone!” Salsa explained.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Okay, now where can the tree be? Let’s look a round the house,” Mom suggested.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>They looked all around the house, but it seemed rather odd that someone would move the tree from one place in the house to another, especially since no one was in the house.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Did aliens abduct the tree, Mama?” Irene asked, but everyone ignored her.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Once they had searched the verandah, kitchen, living room, french windows, attic, bedrooms, Irene said, “But why would anybody steal our Christmas tree, it doesn’t make any sense?”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;It’s a mystery. We need to solve it like the five Find-Outers. Let’s look for clues.” Violet was delighted at the prospect of her solving a mystery. On Christmas Eve too!</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Maybe, we should look in the backyard,” Mom suggested, running out of ideas. They checked the backyard in vain.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Okay I’m going to bed,” said an exhausted Salsa.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;I’ll just fall asleep right here,” said Irene, who looked quite comfortable on the sofa.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Maybe we should take out the fake Christmas tree. It’s better than nothing.” Dad sighed.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Okey-Dokey,” said Irene, who had no intention of helping.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;I’ll lend a hand,” Salsa offered, reluctantly.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Me too,” said Violet, excited for her family hadn’t got around to decorating their tree and she had been disappointed.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Once they had started decorating the fake Christmas tree, the doorbell rang. “I’ll get it,” Mom called from the other room.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Hello, Mary,” the next door neighbor, Sandra said.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Hi, Sandra. Come on in. Would you like anything to drink?” Mom asked.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;No, thank you. Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.” Sandra sat down on the couch in the hall.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Go ahead.” Mom nodded.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;You know, there is a Christmas party going on at an orphanage down town. Yesterday, when I took some toys and clothes, I noticed they had the saddest tree ever. I felt bad for the children there, and so I said they could use my Christmas tree for a party today evening. They said they would pick it up between four and five, and return it by 10:00 sharp. But the pickup has not come to take it, yet. I was wondering if I could borrow your truck to take it there. I need it for my party tomorrow. It’s really urgent, or I wouldn’t have bothered you at all.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;They didn’t come!” Mom was shocked.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Yeah, I couldn’t believe it either. I need it back soon so I can prepare for my party at home. So I want to drop it off there as soon as I can.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Okay, but I’ll come with you. I need to get some milk from the store and it’s on the way.” Mom.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Alright,” Sandra replied.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Can we come too?” Salsa asked. “We need to pick up some decorations for the new tree,” she said sadly looking at the fake tree clad with the scant decorations left over after decorating the real tree, “and we can drop off a box of ginger bread cookies for the orphanage kids.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Yes, please.” Violet and Irene chanted.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Okay, but we need to leave quickly. And we’re going to the orphanage before the decorations store.” Mom helped Sandra load her tree into the truck and secure it with some straps, while Salsa ran into her room to take her pocket money and her second box of cookies.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>The kids squeezed in to the backseat of the pickup.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>It was around seven-thirty when Mom pulled out of their driveway .</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Once they reached, Sandra noticed a receptionist at the front desk. “The name’s Sandra Robinson. I am here to deposit my Christmas tree, as no pickup arrived.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Ma’am the pickup was sent to your house at 5:30 PM. No one was at home. The tree was returned at 7:40 PM.” The receptionist flipped through pages of her book.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;But, I was home at till seven thirty. Oh, okay. In that case, I’d better be going. Hope the party was a success.” Sandra was puzzled.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Salsa shrugged. “These cookies are for the children,” she said, handing them to the receptionist. “I hope I am not too late.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>“Not at all, Dear. They’re opening their presents. I give it to them for supper with their milk. They’ll love it. Thanks so much, Dear.” She walked off with the cookies, as Salsa and Sandra returned to the car.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Before they drove back to Salsa’s house, they stopped at the decorations store, while Sandra told them what the receptionist had said. Everyone was bewildered.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Once they reached back, there was a series of gasps, as family saw the Christmas tree was back. Violet said, “Oh, look, a note. It says ‘Thanks for your donation.’”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Hey,” said Irene. “Do you think it’s possible that there was a mix-up with the address and the charity got the wrong address and came to our house instead of Sandra’s. That explains our missing tree and the fact that Sandra had a tree.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;That is a good explanation,” Violet pointed out.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Well, we’ll never know,” Salsa said.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>Dad came downstairs, amused. “It seems we have donated our Christmas tree to an orphanage under the name Sandra Robinson.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;I knew it!” Irene shouted in contentment. Dad smiled.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;They got the address wrong,” Dad explained.</font size></FONT COLOR></p>



<font size=4px><FONT COLOR=#707070><p>&#8220;Hey, I’d better go to sleep,” Irene said jumping with fright as she glanced at her watch, “or Santa won’t come.”</font size></FONT COLOR></p>
